# Theta Game Rules

Theta is a math-themed card game for 2 to 5 players.

## Objective
Players aim to discard cards until they have only 5 left. With these 5 cards, they form the highest possible mathematical operation. The game ends when all players have 5 cards.
Setup

Each player starts with 11 cards. The remaining cards form the draw pile.

## Actions
Players take turns choosing from these actions:

### Throw
Choose 2 or 3 cards and place them face down. The right-hand neighbor randomly returns one card to the player’s hand. The remaining card(s) go to the bottom of the draw pile.

### Pass
Choose 2 to 4 cards and place them face down. The right-hand neighbor randomly returns one card to the player’s hand. The remaining card(s) go to the left-hand neighbor. Cards cannot be passed to players who have finished playing.

### Draw
Draw one card. If it’s a number, show it and draw a second card. Both cards go into the hand. Drawing is not allowed if you are the last player still playing.

### Special Draw
If a player has multiple identical cards, they can discard them and draw from another player's hand:

    - 2 identical cards: draw 1 card.
    - 3 identical cards: draw 2 cards.
    - N identical cards: draw N-1 cards.

This can force an opponent to finish their game if they reach 5 cards, but cannot reduce their hand to fewer than 5 cards.

## Scoring
Form the highest possible score with the final 5 cards:
Example: 5 x 5 + 1 = 26.
Invalid: 5 x (5+1) = 30 (no parenthesis cards in Theta).

Extra cards result in a penalty of -5 points each:
Example: 5 x 5 + + or 5 x 5 1 1 results in:
5 x 5 [-5] [-5] = 15.
